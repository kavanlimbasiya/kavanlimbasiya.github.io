                                        Journeys end in lovers' meeting. Finally. Yeah. We are here. After what looked like a perpetual journey, we have reached our oasis. Its been 12 yrs since we know each other, and every part of this phenomenal voyage has been great. Happy or sad, rocky or smooth: but the journey has been so good. So here it is in brief how it has been. <br/>
19 June 2003. Mansi's parents decided to change her school for her better future( ;-) ), and mine was the best school in town, hence the obvious choice.
Mansi Khatri, a 5'5" roly poly, with a pony tail and a plump body, was not even the one to be noticed. Only one thing I remember noticing about her was her broad contagious smile, emanating from 2 deep dimples on her chubby cheeks. Not so wow. But. WOW.
And then the days passed like they should. Uneventful. You aren't suppossed to have chemistries when you are learning chemistry in school. But then, fate is what you can blame when you dont want to take it upon you. People started throwing rumours(or as I was told) that she liked me which actually was no where near to truth, but I believed. May be, I just wanted to believe.<br/>
19 June 2004. Then I asked her to be friend one day. I hardly knew what my plans were then if she said yes, but hormones are compulsive. They dont listen. And in a very awkward manner, she said yes. And I was like dancing, fluttering and free, like I could take off the ground at any second. Poems, yeah, my poems. She made me feel like how my poems feel.

                                        Abhay, when I entered school for the first time, he was snobby and arrogant, atleast this is what my first impression was. A 5'11" lean and thin and skinny guy with a thick moustache and a baby face, he had all the ingredients I did not like.
But then he had one thing irresistably sexy. Thoughts. He could think, in the box and out of it too. Mind is what makes a man wanted. And I fell for it. He thinks I fell for his innocence, I had fallen for his ideas.

                                        And the friendship flourished.Chats,talks,icecreams.I even wrote one or two funny letters to her. We werent used to meet much often, but whenever we met, I could feel the sparks exuding between us. She used to make my favourite bhindi for me, I used to bore her with my history and geography blabbering. It is the priviledge of friendship to talk nonsense and to get that respected. But she listened.Patiently. And laughed. And smiled. And she had those two cute dimples and I had them all over!!:-)<br/>
Year 2006. One not so fine day, 12th results came out like a blow.I had scored well but not well enough.I had to get into dental college instead of medical college which I dreamt of. Dentistry was not bad, but it was not my cup of tea certainly.I was shattered.On one hand, I had lost what I wanted and on the other, I had lost what I had got. Mansi had to go to Indore to study dentistry. 700Kms and 14 hrs.I tried to fit into this new reality but I miserably failed.I was downed and depressed and dead but this is when mansi came like an angel.The best thing I loved about her is her attitude towards life. Extreme positivity and coolmindedness.She inspired me to give it a second chance and reappear for entrance. I was initially sceptic as it could cost me a year but she convinced me to give it a shot and repent once than to not give it and repent for life.I started reading again from the scratch and she supported me like anything. Really. From getting up with me at 4 am to calling me to wake me up at 1 am 2 am 3 am and so on. Despite her busy schedule itself, she devoted her each and every minute to me. Preparing notes, making mnemonics, collecting test papers and in the meanwhile, soothing an 18 year old crying boy.Had it not been her, I would have just crumbled under this stress.But I triumphed.rather, she triumphed. I got into medical college the next year.

                                        In a word, abhay was whimsical , atleast in those school days of our relation. I remember him not talking to me for days altogether and then there were days when he used to speak for hours. I precisely remember one incidence when he talked to me for whole night-almost 8 hrs at a stretch, and what did we talk?He gave me laborious lecture on diferent values and ethics and how to approach life. He went on from quoting random unknown, atleast to me, authors, to telling tales of ramayana, mahabharata and geeta.I was getting utterly bored but I dint interrupt.It used to be very rare occassion for abhay to speak so much so fluently.And yeah, those were probably the best life advices I have ever come across anywhere.He has been my personal Morari Bapu.
And I remember 'ABHAY' getting really fearful at only two instances-once, when I drove him out in my sedan for the first time-first time, for us as well as for me;-). He was scared like hell. I was enjoying, naturally, and he was shouting. I wasnt driving that bad, but he- along with many others on road- thought otherwise.I had almost kicked a cow and being a salman khan fan, almost drive over a footpath. But anyway, I laughed a lot during my little adventure that day.And even after that incidence, he has never said no for my driving stints.Dare he.;-)
And the other instance was when I suddenly told him one day that I was being shifted to another city for 12th preparation.You dont know the depth of your relation until the hour of separation. He wasnt shattered, wasnt sad, he was just purely frightened.As if he had felt impending doom, he did all he wanted to do in next many years, in just few days then. Meetings, chats, laughs,gifts,future discussions-everything increased so suddenly.And amid all this, he kept telling me that he would not let me go.Then, I did not go.Dad, or say destiny, had some othar plans.But yeah, it is so beautiful to express love and even more beautiful to feel it.

                                        Initial medical college years were not easy.On one hand,I had no money to spend on keeping LDR (Long Distance relationship) contact with her through phone, while on the other, I badly needed her company as I was finding it hard to fit into new college life, mostly because of my reserved persona.But then, BSNL(Best Scheme for Lovers in Need) helped me.(Government schemes are so insanely cheap that at times, it seems that government is trying to promote love affairs, otherwise for what exactly these night calling schemes are?;-)) I still remember all those nights with my phone warming the side of my face like the sun.Night and day,I was trying to hide my face into mansi's lap to run away from my present. I started realising with time that mansi had become one step answer to all my questions.
With time, things started fitting into place.I had started socialising, got great new friends, became accustomed to college environment and got used to stuffing the belly with whatever on plate. Years passed on. Everything was changing, even my feelings for mansi, which were becoming more and more intense with time. Being in a LDR, we used to meet every 6 monthly or even less frequently than that, but she, esp. her nature, had taken over my senses. For all these years, she wasnt doing anything particular, except for holding my whole universe together.

                                       My college years were never as bad as abhay's initial years were. I had 2 of my best friends with me all the time , and besides that, socialising was my forte. But even in my seemingly busy world, abhay had percolated deep into my inner spaces. I used to eagerly wait for night to fall, and the days he was busy reading(he is such a nerd, he used to read books-story books- after every exam.Yak!), I almost sensed what hypoxia actually is. 700km distance had hardly influenced my feelings. Distance means so little when feelings mean so much.

                                        She had done it, making me happier, better, not by any extra efforts or words or actions , but by just being herself and being with me all through out. Perhaps this is what being a friend means. She had made my life completely different, comfortable and worthwhile.I had opened my heart to her and she filled it with so much joy and love, that a few get love in a relationship; I had got heaven. I never really 'asked' her, but actually I never really had to ask her. During final year and internship, we had drifted from being in a special relationship to being a couple. There were no I and You left, only We.

                                      You know what charm is-a way of getting the answer without asking any clear question.He is such a charmer. I never really felt the absence of D day in our relationship. Everything was so implicit, and yet so explicit. Finally, when he got into his post graduation, we decided to culminate this relationship into marriage.

                                        Parents. The final and probably the most important barrier. I had belled the cat and it became a roller coaster journey between yes and nos, mostly nos;-) But, its a circle of love.Parents' love for their children was even better than our love for each other. They agreed. And agreed like anything. Gifts and muhurts and shoppings and parties flourished. Date was fixed. 26 july. Thats it.So,We are going to start a great journey together from 26/07/2015, with your good wishes. Journeys begin in lovers' meeting.
